Code to calculate the present value of global financial assets with and without climate change using an extended version of the DICE-2016 model based on the work of [Dietz et. al. (2016)]((https://www.nature.com/articles/nclimate2972#MOESM478)https://www.nature.com/articles/nclimate2972#MOESM478). The code is adapted from an original Pyomo implementation of the DICE-2016 model, which can be found [here]((https://github.com/BFavetto/PyDice)https://github.com/BFavetto/PyDice)
